      "ingredients": "1 lb asparagus, 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp kosher salt",
      "steps": "Preheat oven to 425°F. Cut off the woody bottom part of the asparagus spears and discard. With a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears. Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt. With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt. Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them. They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning. They are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal",

Set the mixture aside and allow it to cool until no longer hot to the touch.\n\nIn a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt and granulated sugar, and whisk to combine well. Add the melted butter and chocolate mixture, and mix to combine. Add the beaten eggs and vanilla, and mix to combine. The dough will be thick but soft.\n\nWith a spring-loaded ice cream scoop or two spoons, drop the dough about 2 inches apart in about 24 pieces on the prepared baking sheet (each piece of dough should be about 2 tablespoons’ worth of dough). Roll each piece of dough into a ball between slightly wet palms, coat the dough generously with the confectioner’s sugar, and press the dough into a disk about 1/2-inch thick. Repeat with every piece of dough. Press each piece of cookie dough once more in the confectioners’ sugar, making sure to cover generously in the sugar. Return each piece to its place on the baking sheet.\n\nPlace the baking sheets in the preheated oven, one at a time, and bake for 12 minutes or until just set in the center. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for at least 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely",
